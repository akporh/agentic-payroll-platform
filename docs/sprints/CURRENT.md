# Current Sprint(s)

Names the active sprint workspace(s) — nothing else. See `README.md` for what this folder is, `WORKFLOW.md` for transition rules, `STAGE-REGISTRY.md` for stage definitions.

```yaml
active_sprints: []
```

`active_sprints` is a list shape by design (D9, `docs/diagnostics/2026-07-12-nonlinear-icm-sprint-workflow-implementation-plan.md`), even though exactly one entry is supported and enforced for now — one active sprint at a time. This means multi-sprint support later is a validation-rule change, not a schema migration. It is currently empty because no pilot sprint has been selected — Changeset 2 (pilot sprint workspace creation) has not run. This file is not to be populated with an invented or placeholder sprint ID.
